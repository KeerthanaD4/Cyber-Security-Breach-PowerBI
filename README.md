# Cyber-Security-Breach-PowerBI

## 📘Project Overview
This project presents a detailed analysis of global cyber security breach incidents using interactive Power BI dashboards. The objective is to provide stakeholders with actionable insights into breach trends, types, impact, and data loss severity.

## ✅Key Achivements
-**Data Integration:**
-Integrated structured breach data from a central CSV file.
-Used Power BI to model the dataset and create meaningful relationships.

-**Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
-Preprocessed data using Power BI's Power Query Editor.
-Handled missing values and corrected inconsistencies (e.g., date formats, typos like "Indicviduals").

-**Insightful Dashboards:**
-Built dynamic and visually intuitive dashboards.
-Enabled filtering by breach type, location, country, and department to explore trends interactively.

-**Breach Impact Analysis:**
-Analyzed breach volume, affected individuals, and estimated data loss.
-Highlighted the most common breach vectors and vulnerable departments.

-**Geo-Location Visualization:**
-Visualized breach distribution across different countries and organizational branches.
-Aided strategic planning for risk mitigation in high-threat areas.

## 🛠️ Tools and Skills Utilized
-Power BI: Interactive dashboard development and data modeling.
-Power Query: Data cleaning and transformation within Power BI.
